I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering ([ICME](https://icme.stanford.edu/)) at [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/), where I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Yinyu Ye](https://web.stanford.edu/~yyye/). Before joining Stanford, I received my B.S. degree in Mathematics from the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/).

**Research interest:** My research interests lie broadly at the intersection of data-driven optimization, decision-making under uncertainty, and machine learning with a primary focus on the following: 1) sequential decision-making under uncertainty and online algorithms, 2) linear optimization algorithms and applications for operational decision-making, and 3) machine learning theory and methodology, such as reinforcement learning and human-AI interaction.
