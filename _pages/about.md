I am a fifth-year graduate student in the Institute of Computational and Mathematical Engineering ([ICME](https://icme.stanford.edu/)) at [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/), where I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Yinyu Ye](https://web.stanford.edu/~yyye/). Before joining Stanford, I received my B.S. degree in Mathematics from the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/).
